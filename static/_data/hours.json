He is first, by translation of his name, king of righteousness, and then he is also king of Salem, that is, king of peace. <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v58007003-1\">3&nbsp;</b>He is without father or

who receive the priestly office have a commandment in the law to take tithes from the people, that is, from their brothers, though these also are descended from Abraham. <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v58007006-1\">6&nbsp;</b>But this man who does not have his descent from them received tithes from Abraham and blessed him who had the promises. <b class=\"verse-num\"
