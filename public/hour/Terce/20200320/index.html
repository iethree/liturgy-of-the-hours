<p>I saw no temple in the city,<br>
for its temple is the Lord God the Almighty<br>
and the Lamb.</p>
<p>And the city has no need of sun or moon<br>
to shine upon it,<br>
for the glory of God is its light,<br>
and its lamp is the Lamb.</p>
<p>By its light the nations shall walk,<br>
and the rulers of the earth<br>
shall bring their glory into it.</p>
<p>Its gates shall never be shut by day,<br>
nor shall there be any night;<br>
they shall bring into it<br>
the glory and honour of the nations.</p>
<p>I saw the river of the water of life,<br>
bright as crystal,<br>
flowing from the throne of God and of the Lamb.</p>
<p>And either side of the river stood the tree of life,<br>
yielding its fruit each month,<br>
and the leaves of the tree<br>
were for the healing of the nations.</p>
<p>The throne of God and of the Lamb shall be there,<br>
and his servants shall worship him;<br>
and they shall see his face<br>
and his name shall be on their foreheads.</p>
