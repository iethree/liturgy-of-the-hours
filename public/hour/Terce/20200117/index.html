<p>God reckons as righteous those who believe,<br>
who believe in him who raised Jesus from the dead;</p>
<p>For Christ was handed over to death for our sins,<br>
and raised to life for our justification.</p>
<p>Since we are justified by faith,<br>
we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>Through Christ we have gained access<br>
to the grace in which we stand,<br>
and rejoice in our hope of the glory of God.</p>
<p>We even exult in our sufferings,<br>
for suffering produces endurance,</p>
<p>And endurance brings hope,<br>
and our hope is not in vain,</p>
<p>Because God’s love has been poured into our hearts,<br>
through the Holy Spirit, given to us.</p>
<p>God proves his love for us:<br>
while we were yet sinners Christ died for us.</p>
<p>Since we have been justified by his death,<br>
how much more shall we be saved from God’s wrath.</p>
<p>Therefore, we exult in God through our Lord Jesus Christ,<br>
in whom we have now received our reconciliation.</p>
