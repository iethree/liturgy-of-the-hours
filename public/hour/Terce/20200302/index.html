<p>The law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus<br>
has set us free from the law of sin and death.</p>
<p>All who are led by the Spirit of God are children of God;<br>
for we have received the Spirit that enables us to cry, ‘Abba, Father’.</p>
<p>The Spirit himself bears witness that we are children of God<br>
and if God’s children, then heirs of God;</p>
<p>If heirs of God, then fellow-heirs with Christ;<br>
since we suffer with him now, that we may be glorified with him.</p>
<p>These sufferings that we now endure<br>
are not worth comparing to the glory that shall be revealed.</p>
<p>For the creation waits with eager longing<br>
for the revealing of the children of God.</p>
