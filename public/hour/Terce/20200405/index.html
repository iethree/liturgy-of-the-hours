<span class="indent"> he has come to his people and set them free.    </span>
He has raised up for us a mighty savior,<br>
<span class="indent"> born of the house of his servant David.    </span>
Through his holy prophets he promised of old,<br>
that he would save us from our enemies,<br>
<span class="indent"> from the hands of all who hate us.    </span>
He promised to show mercy to our fathers<br>
<span class="indent"> and to remember his holy covenant.    </span>
This was the oath he swore to our father Abraham,<br>
<span class="indent"> to set us free from the hands of our enemies,    </span>
Free to worship him without fear,<br>
<span class="indent"> holy and righteous in his sight    </span>
<span class="indent"> all the days of our life.  </span></p>
<p>You, my child, shall be called the prophet of the Most High,<br>
<span class="indent"> for you will go before the Lord to prepare his way,    </span>
To give his people knowledge of salvation<br>
<span class="indent"> by the forgiveness of their sins.    </span>
In the tender compassion of our God<br>
<span class="indent"> the dawn from on high shall break upon us,    </span>
To shine on those who dwell in darkness and the<br>
shadow of death,<br>
<span class="indent"> and to guide our feet into the way of peace.  </span></p>
<p>Glory to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit:<br>
<span class="indent"> as it was in the beginning, is now, and will be for ever. Amen.  </span></p>
