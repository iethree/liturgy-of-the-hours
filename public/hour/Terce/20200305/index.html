                              The Second Song of Isaiah
                           </h3>
                        
                        <p>Seek the Lord while he wills to be found;<br>
<span class="indent"> call upon him when he draws near.    </span>
Let the wicked forsake their ways<br>
<span class="indent"> and the evil ones their thoughts;    </span>
And let them turn to the Lord, and he will have compassion,<br>
<span class="indent"> and to our God, for he will richly pardon.    </span>
For my thoughts are not your thoughts,<br>
<span class="indent"> nor your ways my ways, says the Lord.    </span>
For as the heavens are higher than the earth,<br>
<span class="indent"> so are my ways higher than your ways,    </span>
<span class="indent"> and my thoughts than your thoughts.  </span></p>
<p>For as rain and snow fall from the heavens<br>
<span class="indent"> and return not again, but water the earth,    </span>
Bringing forth life and giving growth,<br>
<span class="indent"> seed for sowing and bread for eating,    </span>
So is my word that goes forth from my mouth;<br>
<span class="indent"> it will not return to me empty;    </span>
But it will accomplish that which I have purposed,<br>
<span class="indent"> and prosper in that for which I sent it.  </span></p>
<p>Glory to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit:<br>
<span class="indent"> as it was in the beginning, is now, and will be for ever. Amen.  </span></p>

                        <p>O God, whose fatherly care reacheth to the uttermost parts of the earth: We humbly beseech thee graciously to behold and bless those whom we love, now absent from us. Defend them from all dangers of soul and body; and grant that both they and we, drawing nearer to thee, may be bound together by thy love in the communion of thy Holy Spirit, and in the fellowship of thy saints; through Jesus Christ our Lord. <em>Amen</em>.</p>
