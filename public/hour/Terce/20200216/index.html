                        <p>O Lord and Ruler of the hosts of heaven,<br>
<span class="indent"> God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob,    </span>
<span class="indent"> and of all their righteous offspring:    </span>
You made the heavens and the earth,<br>
<span class="indent"> with all their vast array.  </span></p>
<p>All things quake with fear at your presence;<br>
<span class="indent"> they tremble because of your power.    </span>
But your merciful promise is beyond all measure;<br>
<span class="indent"> it surpasses all that our minds can fathom.    </span>
O Lord, you are full of compassion,<br>
<span class="indent"> long-suffering, and abounding in mercy.    </span>
You hold back your hand;<br>
<span class="indent"> you do not punish as we deserve.    </span>
In your great goodness, Lord,<br>
you have promised forgiveness to sinners,<br>
<span class="indent"> that they may repent of their sin and be saved.    </span>
And now, O Lord, I bend the knee of my heart,<br>
<span class="indent"> and make my appeal, sure of your gracious goodness.    </span>
I have sinned, O Lord, I have sinned,<br>
<span class="indent"> and I know my wickedness only too well.    </span>
Therefore I make this prayer to you:<br>
<span class="indent"> Forgive me, Lord, forgive me.    </span>
Do not let me perish in my sin,<br>
<span class="indent"> nor condemn me to the depths of the earth.    </span>
For you, O Lord, are the God of those who repent,<br>
<span class="indent"> and in me you will show forth your goodness.    </span>
Unworthy as I am, you will save me,<br>
in accordance with your great mercy,<br>
<span class="indent"> and I will praise you without ceasing all the days of my life.    </span>
For all the powers of heaven sing your praises,<br>
<span class="indent"> and yours is the glory to ages of ages. Amen. </span></p>
