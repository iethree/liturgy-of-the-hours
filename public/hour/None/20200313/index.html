<p id="p46007001_04-1" class="starts-chapter"><b class="chapter-num" id="v46007001-1">7:1&nbsp;</b>Now concerning the matters about which you wrote: “It is good for a man not to have sexual relations with a woman.” <b class="verse-num" id="v46007002-1">2&nbsp;</b>But because of the temptation to sexual immorality, each man should have his own wife and each woman her own husband. <b class="verse-num" id="v46007003-1">3&nbsp;</b>The husband should give to his wife her conjugal rights, and likewise the wife to her husband. <b class="verse-num" id="v46007004-1">4&nbsp;</b>For the wife does not have authority over her own body, but the husband does. Likewise the husband does not have authority over his own body, but the wife does. <b class="verse-num" id="v46007005-1">5&nbsp;</b>Do not deprive one another, except perhaps by agreement for a limited time, that you may devote yourselves to prayer; but then come together again, so that Satan may not tempt you because of your lack of self-control.</p>
<p id="p46007005_04-1"><b class="verse-num" id="v46007006-1">6&nbsp;</b>Now as a concession, not a command, I say this. <b class="verse-num" id="v46007007-1">7&nbsp;</b>I wish that all were as I myself am. But each has his own gift from God, one of one kind and one of another.</p>
<p id="p46007007_04-1"><b class="verse-num" id="v46007008-1">8&nbsp;</b>To the unmarried and the widows I say that it is good for them to remain single, as I am. <b class="verse-num" id="v46007009-1">9&nbsp;</b>But if they cannot exercise self-control, they should marry. For it is better to marry than to burn with passion.</p>
