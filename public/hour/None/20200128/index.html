<h3 id="p58009001_01-1">The Earthly Holy Place</h3>
<p id="p58009001_05-1" class="starts-chapter"><b class="chapter-num" id="v58009001-1">9:1&nbsp;</b>Now even the first covenant had regulations for worship and an earthly place of holiness. <b class="verse-num" id="v58009002-1">2&nbsp;</b>For a tent was prepared, the first section, in which were the lampstand and the table and the bread of the Presence. It is called the Holy Place. <b class="verse-num" id="v58009003-1">3&nbsp;</b>Behind the second curtain was a second section called the Most Holy Place, <b class="verse-num" id="v58009004-1">4&nbsp;</b>having the golden altar of incense and the ark of the covenant covered on all sides with gold, in which was a golden urn holding the manna, and Aaron's staff that budded, and the tablets of the covenant. <b class="verse-num" id="v58009005-1">5&nbsp;</b>Above it were the cherubim of glory overshadowing the mercy seat. Of these things we cannot now speak in detail.</p>
<p id="p58009005_05-1"><b class="verse-num" id="v58009006-1">6&nbsp;</b>These preparations having thus been made, the priests go regularly into the first section, performing their ritual duties, <b class="verse-num" id="v58009007-1">7&nbsp;</b>but into the second only the high priest goes, and he but once a year, and not without taking blood, which he offers for himself and for the unintentional sins of the people. <b class="verse-num" id="v58009008-1">8&nbsp;</b>By this the Holy Spirit indicates that the way into the holy places is not yet opened as long as the first section is still standing <b class="verse-num" id="v58009009-1">9&nbsp;</b>(which is symbolic for the present age). According to this arrangement, gifts and sacrifices are offered that cannot perfect the conscience of the worshiper, <b class="verse-num" id="v58009010-1">10&nbsp;</b>but deal only with food and drink and various washings, regulations for the body imposed until the time of reformation.</p>
<h3 id="p58009010_05-1">Redemption Through the Blood of Christ</h3>
<p id="p58009010_11-1"><b class="verse-num" id="v58009011-1">11&nbsp;</b>But when Christ appeared as a high priest of the good things that have come, then through the greater and more perfect tent (not made with hands, that is, not of this creation) <b class="verse-num" id="v58009012-1">12&nbsp;</b>he entered once for all into the holy places, not by means of the blood of goats and calves but by means of his own blood, thus securing an eternal redemption. <b class="verse-num" id="v58009013-1">13&nbsp;</b>For if the blood of goats and bulls, and the sprinkling of defiled persons with the ashes of a heifer, sanctify for the purification of the flesh, <b class="verse-num" id="v58009014-1">14&nbsp;</b>how much more will the blood of Christ, who through the eternal Spirit offered himself without blemish to God, purify our conscience from dead works to serve the living God.</p>
