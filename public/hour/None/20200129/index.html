<p id="p58009015_01-1"><b class="verse-num" id="v58009015-1">15&nbsp;</b>Therefore he is the mediator of a new covenant, so that those who are called may receive the promised eternal inheritance, since a death has occurred that redeems them from the transgressions committed under the first covenant. <b class="verse-num" id="v58009016-1">16&nbsp;</b>For where a will is involved, the death of the one who made it must be established. <b class="verse-num" id="v58009017-1">17&nbsp;</b>For a will takes effect only at death, since it is not in force as long as the one who made it is alive. <b class="verse-num" id="v58009018-1">18&nbsp;</b>Therefore not even the first covenant was inaugurated without blood. <b class="verse-num" id="v58009019-1">19&nbsp;</b>For when every commandment of the law had been declared by Moses to all the people, he took the blood of calves and goats, with water and scarlet wool and hyssop, and sprinkled both the book itself and all the people, <b class="verse-num" id="v58009020-1">20&nbsp;</b>saying, “This is the blood of the covenant that God commanded for you.” <b class="verse-num" id="v58009021-1">21&nbsp;</b>And in the same way he sprinkled with the blood both the tent and all the vessels used in worship. <b class="verse-num" id="v58009022-1">22&nbsp;</b>Indeed, under the law almost everything is purified with blood, and without the shedding of blood there is no forgiveness of sins.</p>
<p id="p58009022_01-1"><b class="verse-num" id="v58009023-1">23&nbsp;</b>Thus it was necessary for the copies of the heavenly things to be purified with these rites, but the heavenly things themselves with better sacrifices than these. <b class="verse-num" id="v58009024-1">24&nbsp;</b>For Christ has entered, not into holy places made with hands, which are copies of the true things, but into heaven itself, now to appear in the presence of God on our behalf. <b class="verse-num" id="v58009025-1">25&nbsp;</b>Nor was it to offer himself repeatedly, as the high priest enters the holy places every year with blood not his own, <b class="verse-num" id="v58009026-1">26&nbsp;</b>for then he would have had to suffer repeatedly since the foundation of the world. But as it is, he has appeared once for all at the end of the ages to put away sin by the sacrifice of himself. <b class="verse-num" id="v58009027-1">27&nbsp;</b>And just as it is appointed for man to die once, and after that comes judgment, <b class="verse-num" id="v58009028-1">28&nbsp;</b>so Christ, having been offered once to bear the sins of many, will appear a second time, not to deal with sin but to save those who are eagerly waiting for him.</p>
