<p id="p46007032_01-1"><b class="verse-num" id="v46007032-1">32&nbsp;</b>I want you to be free from anxieties. The unmarried man is anxious about the things of the Lord, how to please the Lord. <b class="verse-num" id="v46007033-1">33&nbsp;</b>But the married man is anxious about worldly things, how to please his wife, <b class="verse-num" id="v46007034-1">34&nbsp;</b>and his interests are divided. And the unmarried or betrothed woman is anxious about the things of the Lord, how to be holy in body and spirit. But the married woman is anxious about worldly things, how to please her husband. <b class="verse-num" id="v46007035-1">35&nbsp;</b>I say this for your own benefit, not to lay any restraint upon you, but to promote good order and to secure your undivided devotion to the Lord.</p>
<p id="p46007035_01-1"><b class="verse-num" id="v46007036-1">36&nbsp;</b>If anyone thinks that he is not behaving properly toward his betrothed, if his passions are strong, and it has to be, let him do as he wishes: let them marry—it is no sin. <b class="verse-num" id="v46007037-1">37&nbsp;</b>But whoever is firmly established in his heart, being under no necessity but having his desire under control, and has determined this in his heart, to keep her as his betrothed, he will do well. <b class="verse-num" id="v46007038-1">38&nbsp;</b>So then he who marries his betrothed does well, and he who refrains from marriage will do even better.</p>
<p id="p46007038_01-1"><b class="verse-num" id="v46007039-1">39&nbsp;</b>A wife is bound to her husband as long as he lives. But if her husband dies, she is free to be married to whom she wishes, only in the Lord. <b class="verse-num" id="v46007040-1">40&nbsp;</b>Yet in my judgment she is happier if she remains as she is. And I think that I too have the Spirit of God.</p>
