Abhor what is evil; hold fast to what is good. <b class="verse-num" id="v45012010-1">10&nbsp;</b>Love one another with brotherly affection. Outdo one another in showing honor. <b class="verse-num" id="v45012011-1">11&nbsp;</b>Do not be slothful in zeal, be fervent in spirit, serve the Lord. <b class="verse-num" id="v45012012-1">12&nbsp;</b>Rejoice in hope, be patient in tribulation, be constant in prayer. <b class="verse-num" id="v45012013-1">13&nbsp;</b>Contribute to the needs of the saints and seek to show hospitality.</p>

Do not be haughty, but associate with the lowly. Never be wise in your own sight. <b class="verse-num" id="v45012017-1">17&nbsp;</b>Repay no one evil for evil, but give thought to do what is honorable in the sight of all. <b class="verse-num" id="v45012018-1">18&nbsp;</b>If possible, so far as it depends on you, live peaceably with all. <b class="verse-num" id="v45012019-1">19&nbsp;</b>Beloved, never avenge yourselves, but leave it to the wrath of God, for it is written, “Vengeance is mine, I will repay, says the Lord.” <b class="verse-num" id="v45012020-1">20&nbsp;</b>To the contrary, “if your enemy is hungry, feed him; if he is thirsty, give him something to drink; for by so doing you will heap burning coals on his head.” <b class="verse-num" id="v45012021-1">21&nbsp;</b>Do not be overcome by evil, but overcome evil with good.</p>
