<p id="p51003004_06-1"><b class="verse-num" id="v51003005-1">5&nbsp;</b>Put to death therefore what is earthly in you: sexual immorality, impurity, passion, evil desire, and covetousness, which is idolatry. <b class="verse-num" id="v51003006-1">6&nbsp;</b>On account of these the wrath of God is coming. <b class="verse-num" id="v51003007-1">7&nbsp;</b>In these you too once walked, when you were living in them. <b class="verse-num" id="v51003008-1">8&nbsp;</b>But now you must put them all away: anger, wrath, malice, slander, and obscene talk from your mouth. <b class="verse-num" id="v51003009-1">9&nbsp;</b>Do not lie to one another, seeing that you have put off the old self with its practices <b class="verse-num" id="v51003010-1">10&nbsp;</b>and have put on the new self, which is being renewed in knowledge after the image of its creator. <b class="verse-num" id="v51003011-1">11&nbsp;</b>Here there is not Greek and Jew, circumcised and uncircumcised, barbarian, Scythian, slave, free; but Christ is all, and in all.</p>
<p id="p51003011_06-1"><b class="verse-num" id="v51003012-1">12&nbsp;</b>Put on then, as God's chosen ones, holy and beloved, compassionate hearts, kindness, humility, meekness, and patience, <b class="verse-num" id="v51003013-1">13&nbsp;</b>bearing with one another and, if one has a complaint against another, forgiving each other; as the Lord has forgiven you, so you also must forgive. <b class="verse-num" id="v51003014-1">14&nbsp;</b>And above all these put on love, which binds everything together in perfect harmony. <b class="verse-num" id="v51003015-1">15&nbsp;</b>And let the peace of Christ rule in your hearts, to which indeed you were called in one body. And be thankful. <b class="verse-num" id="v51003016-1">16&nbsp;</b>Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly, teaching and admonishing one another in all wisdom, singing psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, with thankfulness in your hearts to God. <b class="verse-num" id="v51003017-1">17&nbsp;</b>And whatever you do, in word or deed, do everything in the name of the Lord Jesus, giving thanks to God the Father through him.</p>
