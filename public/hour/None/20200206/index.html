For time would fail me to tell of Gideon, Barak, Samson, Jephthah, of David and Samuel and the prophets—<b class="verse-num" id="v58011033-1">33&nbsp;</b>who through faith conquered kingdoms, enforced justice, obtained promises, stopped the mouths of lions, <b class="verse-num" id="v58011034-1">34&nbsp;</b>quenched the power of fire, escaped the edge of the sword, were made strong out of weakness, became mighty in war, put foreign armies to flight. <b class="verse-num" id="v58011035-1">35&nbsp;</b>Women received back their dead by resurrection.

as you died for love of our love.</p>
