<p id="p46005009_01-1"><b class="verse-num" id="v46005009-1">9&nbsp;</b>I wrote to you in my letter not to associate with sexually immoral people—<b class="verse-num" id="v46005010-1">10&nbsp;</b>not at all meaning the sexually immoral of this world, or the greedy and swindlers, or idolaters, since then you would need to go out of the world. <b class="verse-num" id="v46005011-1">11&nbsp;</b>But now I am writing to you not to associate with anyone who bears the name of brother if he is guilty of sexual immorality or greed, or is an idolater, reviler, drunkard, or swindler—not even to eat with such a one. <b class="verse-num" id="v46005012-1">12&nbsp;</b>For what have I to do with judging outsiders? Is it not those inside the church whom you are to judge? <b class="verse-num" id="v46005013-1">13&nbsp;</b>God judges those outside. “Purge the evil person from among you.”</p>

<p id="p46006001_04-1" class="starts-chapter"><b class="chapter-num" id="v46006001-1">6:1&nbsp;</b>When one of you has a grievance against another, does he dare go to law before the unrighteous instead of the saints? <b class="verse-num" id="v46006002-1">2&nbsp;</b>Or do you not know that the saints will judge the world? And if the world is to be judged by you, are you incompetent to try trivial cases? <b class="verse-num" id="v46006003-1">3&nbsp;</b>Do you not know that we are to judge angels? How much more, then, matters pertaining to this life! <b class="verse-num" id="v46006004-1">4&nbsp;</b>So if you have such cases, why do you lay them before those who have no standing in the church? <b class="verse-num" id="v46006005-1">5&nbsp;</b>I say this to your shame. Can it be that there is no one among you wise enough to settle a dispute between the brothers, <b class="verse-num" id="v46006006-1">6&nbsp;</b>but brother goes to law against brother, and that before unbelievers? <b class="verse-num" id="v46006007-1">7&nbsp;</b>To have lawsuits at all with one another is already a defeat for you. Why not rather suffer wrong? Why not rather be defrauded? <b class="verse-num" id="v46006008-1">8&nbsp;</b>But you yourselves wrong and defraud—even your own brothers!</p>
