<p id="p46012012_06-1"><b class="verse-num" id="v46012012-1">12&nbsp;</b>For just as the body is one and has many members, and all the members of the body, though many, are one body, so it is with Christ. <b class="verse-num" id="v46012013-1">13&nbsp;</b>For in one Spirit we were all baptized into one body—Jews or Greeks, slaves or free—and all were made to drink of one Spirit.</p>
<p id="p46012013_06-1"><b class="verse-num" id="v46012014-1">14&nbsp;</b>For the body does not consist of one member but of many. <b class="verse-num" id="v46012015-1">15&nbsp;</b>If the foot should say, “Because I am not a hand, I do not belong to the body,” that would not make it any less a part of the body. <b class="verse-num" id="v46012016-1">16&nbsp;</b>And if the ear should say, “Because I am not an eye, I do not belong to the body,” that would not make it any less a part of the body. <b class="verse-num" id="v46012017-1">17&nbsp;</b>If the whole body were an eye, where would be the sense of hearing? If the whole body were an ear, where would be the sense of smell? <b class="verse-num" id="v46012018-1">18&nbsp;</b>But as it is, God arranged the members in the body, each one of them, as he chose. <b class="verse-num" id="v46012019-1">19&nbsp;</b>If all were a single member, where would the body be? <b class="verse-num" id="v46012020-1">20&nbsp;</b>As it is, there are many parts, yet one body.</p>
<p id="p46012020_06-1"><b class="verse-num" id="v46012021-1">21&nbsp;</b>The eye cannot say to the hand, “I have no need of you,” nor again the head to the feet, “I have no need of you.” <b class="verse-num" id="v46012022-1">22&nbsp;</b>On the contrary, the parts of the body that seem to be weaker are indispensable, <b class="verse-num" id="v46012023-1">23&nbsp;</b>and on those parts of the body that we think less honorable we bestow the greater honor, and our unpresentable parts are treated with greater modesty, <b class="verse-num" id="v46012024-1">24&nbsp;</b>which our more presentable parts do not require. But God has so composed the body, giving greater honor to the part that lacked it, <b class="verse-num" id="v46012025-1">25&nbsp;</b>that there may be no division in the body, but that the members may have the same care for one another. <b class="verse-num" id="v46012026-1">26&nbsp;</b>If one member suffers, all suffer together; if one member is honored, all rejoice together.</p>
