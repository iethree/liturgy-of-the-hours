But if anyone does sin, we have an advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous. <b class="verse-num" id="v62002002-1">2&nbsp;</b>He is the propitiation for our sins, and not for ours only but also for the sins of the whole world. <b class="verse-num" id="v62002003-1">3&nbsp;</b>And by this we know that we have come to know him, if we keep his commandments. <b class="verse-num" id="v62002004-1">4&nbsp;</b>Whoever says “I know him” but does not keep his commandments is a liar, and the truth is not in him, <b class="verse-num" id="v62002005-1">5&nbsp;</b>but whoever keeps his word, in him truly the love of God is perfected.

The old commandment is the word that you have heard. <b class="verse-num" id="v62002008-1">8&nbsp;</b>At the same time, it is a new commandment that I am writing to you, which is true in him and in you, because the darkness is passing away and the true light is already shining. <b class="verse-num" id="v62002009-1">9&nbsp;</b>Whoever says he is in the light and hates his brother is still in darkness. <b class="verse-num" id="v62002010-1">10&nbsp;</b>Whoever loves his brother abides in the light, and in him there is no cause for stumbling. <b class="verse-num" id="v62002011-1">11&nbsp;</b>But whoever hates his brother is in the darkness and walks in the darkness, and does not know where he is going, because the darkness has blinded his eyes.</p>
