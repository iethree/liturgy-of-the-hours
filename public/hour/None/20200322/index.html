Father!” <b class="verse-num" id="v45008016-1">16&nbsp;</b>The Spirit himself bears witness with our spirit that we are children of God, <b class="verse-num" id="v45008017-1">17&nbsp;</b>and if children, then heirs—heirs of God and fellow heirs with Christ, provided we suffer with him in order that we may also be glorified with him.</p>

Now hope that is seen is not hope. For who hopes for what he sees? <b class="verse-num" id="v45008025-1">25&nbsp;</b>But if we hope for what we do not see, we wait for it with patience.</p>
