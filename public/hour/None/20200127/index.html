<p id="p48001002_02-1">To the churches of Galatia:</p>
<p id="p48001002_02-1"><b class="verse-num" id="v48001003-1">3&nbsp;</b>Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ, <b class="verse-num" id="v48001004-1">4&nbsp;</b>who gave himself for our sins to deliver us from the present evil age, according to the will of our God and Father, <b class="verse-num" id="v48001005-1">5&nbsp;</b>to whom be the glory forever and ever.

<p id="p48001005_05-1"><b class="verse-num" id="v48001006-1">6&nbsp;</b>I am astonished that you are so quickly deserting him who called you in the grace of Christ and are turning to a different gospel—<b class="verse-num" id="v48001007-1">7&nbsp;</b>not that there is another one, but there are some who trouble you and want to distort the gospel of Christ. <b class="verse-num" id="v48001008-1">8&nbsp;</b>But even if we or an angel from heaven should preach to you a gospel contrary to the one we preached to you, let him be accursed. <b class="verse-num" id="v48001009-1">9&nbsp;</b>As we have said before, so now I say again: If anyone is preaching to you a gospel contrary to the one you received, let him be accursed.</p>

<p id="p48001010_09-1"><b class="verse-num" id="v48001011-1">11&nbsp;</b>For I would have you know, brothers, that the gospel that was preached by me is not man's gospel. <b class="verse-num" id="v48001012-1">12&nbsp;</b>For I did not receive it from any man, nor was I taught it, but I received it through a revelation of Jesus Christ. <b class="verse-num" id="v48001013-1">13&nbsp;</b>For you have heard of my former life in Judaism, how I persecuted the church of God violently and tried to destroy it. <b class="verse-num" id="v48001014-1">14&nbsp;</b>And I was advancing in Judaism beyond many of my own age among my people, so extremely zealous was I for the traditions of my fathers. <b class="verse-num" id="v48001015-1">15&nbsp;</b>But when he who had set me apart before I was born, and who called me by his grace, <b class="verse-num" id="v48001016-1">16&nbsp;</b>was pleased to reveal his Son to me, in order that I might preach him among the Gentiles, I did not immediately consult with anyone; <b class="verse-num" id="v48001017-1">17&nbsp;</b>nor did I go up to Jerusalem to those who were apostles before me, but I went away into Arabia, and returned again to Damascus.</p>
