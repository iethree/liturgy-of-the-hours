Do not seek a wife. <b class="verse-num" id="v46007028-1">28&nbsp;</b>But if you do marry, you have not sinned, and if a betrothed woman marries, she has not sinned. Yet those who marry will have worldly troubles, and I would spare you that. <b class="verse-num" id="v46007029-1">29&nbsp;</b>This is what I mean, brothers: the appointed time has grown very short. From now on, let those who have wives live as though they had none, <b class="verse-num" id="v46007030-1">30&nbsp;</b>and those who mourn as though they were not mourning, and those who rejoice as though they were not rejoicing, and those who buy as though they had no goods, <b class="verse-num" id="v46007031-1">31&nbsp;</b>and those who deal with the world as though they had no dealings with it.
