<p id="p58002001_05-1" class="starts-chapter"><b class="chapter-num" id="v58002001-1">2:1&nbsp;</b>Therefore we must pay much closer attention to what we have heard, lest we drift away from it. <b class="verse-num" id="v58002002-1">2&nbsp;</b>For since the message declared by angels proved to be reliable, and every transgression or disobedience received a just retribution, <b class="verse-num" id="v58002003-1">3&nbsp;</b>how shall we escape if we neglect such a great salvation? It was declared at first by the Lord, and it was attested to us by those who heard, <b class="verse-num" id="v58002004-1">4&nbsp;</b>while God also bore witness by signs and wonders and various miracles and by gifts of the Holy Spirit distributed according to his will.</p>
<h3 id="p58002004_05-1">The Founder of Salvation</h3>
<p id="p58002004_09-1"><b class="verse-num" id="v58002005-1">5&nbsp;</b>For it was not to angels that God subjected the world to come, of which we are speaking. <b class="verse-num" id="v58002006-1">6&nbsp;</b>It has been testified somewhere,</p>
<p class="block-indent"><span class="begin-line-group"></span>

</p><p id="p58002008_09-1" class="same-paragraph">Now in putting everything in subjection to him, he left nothing outside his control. At present, we do not yet see everything in subjection to him. <b class="verse-num" id="v58002009-1">9&nbsp;</b>But we see him who for a little while was made lower than the angels, namely Jesus, crowned with glory and honor because of the suffering of death, so that by the grace of God he might taste death for everyone.</p>
<p id="p58002009_09-1"><b class="verse-num" id="v58002010-1">10&nbsp;</b>For it was fitting that he, for whom and by whom all things exist, in bringing many sons to glory, should make the founder of their salvation perfect through suffering.</p>
