<p id="p46015001_05-1" class="starts-chapter"><b class="chapter-num" id="v46015001-1">15:1&nbsp;</b>Now I would remind you, brothers, of the gospel I preached to you, which you received, in which you stand, <b class="verse-num" id="v46015002-1">2&nbsp;</b>and by which you are being saved, if you hold fast to the word I preached to you—unless you believed in vain.</p>
<p id="p46015002_05-1"><b class="verse-num" id="v46015003-1">3&nbsp;</b>For I delivered to you as of first importance what I also received: that Christ died for our sins in accordance with the Scriptures, <b class="verse-num" id="v46015004-1">4&nbsp;</b>that he was buried, that he was raised on the third day in accordance with the Scriptures, <b class="verse-num" id="v46015005-1">5&nbsp;</b>and that he appeared to Cephas, then to the twelve. <b class="verse-num" id="v46015006-1">6&nbsp;</b>Then he appeared to more than five hundred brothers at one time, most of whom are still alive, though some have fallen asleep. <b class="verse-num" id="v46015007-1">7&nbsp;</b>Then he appeared to James, then to all the apostles. <b class="verse-num" id="v46015008-1">8&nbsp;</b>Last of all, as to one untimely born, he appeared also to me. <b class="verse-num" id="v46015009-1">9&nbsp;</b>For I am the least of the apostles, unworthy to be called an apostle, because I persecuted the church of God. <b class="verse-num" id="v46015010-1">10&nbsp;</b>But by the grace of God I am what I am, and his grace toward me was not in vain. On the contrary, I worked harder than any of them, though it was not I, but the grace of God that is with me. <b class="verse-num" id="v46015011-1">11&nbsp;</b>Whether then it was I or they, so we preach and so you believed.</p>
