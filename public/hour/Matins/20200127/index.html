He has filled the hungry with good things,<br>
<span class="indent"> and the rich he has sent away empty.    </span>
He has come to the help of his servant Israel,<br>
<span class="indent"> for he has remembered his promise of mercy,    </span>
The promise he made to our fathers,<br>
<span class="indent"> to Abraham and his children for ever.  </span></p>
