                        <p>In peace, let us pray to the Lord, saying, &quot;Lord, have mercy&quot;</p>
<p>For the holy Church of God, that it may be filled with truth and love, and be found without fault at the day of your coming, we pray to you, O Lord.
<span class="indent"> <strong>Lord, have mercy</strong> </span></p>
<p>For all bishops and other ministers, and for all the holy people of God, we pray to you, O Lord.
<span class="indent"> <strong>Lord, have mercy</strong> </span></p>
<p>For all who fear God and believe in you, Lord Christ, that our divisions may cease, and that all may be one as you and the Father are one, we pray to you, O Lord.
<span class="indent"> <strong>Lord, have mercy</strong> </span></p>
<p>For the mission of the Church, that in faithful witness it may preach the Gospel to the ends of the earth, we pray to you, O Lord.
<span class="indent"> <strong>Lord, have mercy</strong> </span></p>
<p>For those who do not yet believe, and for those who have lost their faith, that they may receive the light of the Gospel, we pray to you, O Lord.
<span class="indent"> <strong>Lord, have mercy</strong> </span></p>
<p>For the peace of the world, that a spirit of respect and forbearance may grow among nations and peoples, we pray to you, O Lord.
<span class="indent"> <strong>Lord, have mercy</strong> </span></p>
<p>For those in positions of public trust that they may serve justice, and promote the dignity and freedom of every person, we pray to you, O Lord.
<span class="indent"> <strong>Lord, have mercy</strong> </span></p>
<p>For all who live and work in this community.
<span class="indent"> <strong>Lord, have mercy</strong> </span></p>
<p>For a blessing upon all human labor, and for the right use of the riches of creation, that the world may be freed from poverty, famine, and disaster, we pray to you, O Lord.
<span class="indent"> <strong>Lord, have mercy</strong> </span></p>
<p>For the poor, the persecuted, the sick, and all who suffer; for refugees, prisoners, and all who are in danger; that they may be relieved and protected, we pray to you, O Lord.
<span class="indent"> <strong>Lord, have mercy</strong> </span></p>
<p>For our congregation, that we may be delivered from hardness of heart, and show forth your glory in all that we do, we pray to you, O Lord.
<span class="indent"> <strong>Lord, have mercy</strong> </span></p>
<p>For our enemies and those who wish us harm, and for all whom we have injured or offended, we pray to you, O Lord. For ourselves; for the forgiveness of our sins, and for the grace of the Holy Spirit to amend our lives, we pray to you, O Lord.
<span class="indent"> <strong>Lord, have mercy</strong> </span></p>
<p>For all who have commended themselves to our prayers; for our families, friends, and neighbors; that being freed from anxiety, they may live in joy, peace, and health, we pray to you, O Lord.
<span class="indent"> <strong>Lord, have mercy</strong> </span></p>
<p>For all who have died in the communion of your Church, and those whose faith is known to you alone, that, with all the saints, they may have rest in that place where there is no pain or grief, but life eternal, we pray to you, O Lord.
<span class="indent"> <strong>Lord, have mercy</strong> </span></p>
<p>Rejoicing in the fellowship of all the saints, let us commend ourselves, and one another, and all our life to Christ our God.
<span class="indent"> <strong>To you, O Lord our God.</strong> </span></p>
<p>For yours is the majesty, O Father, Son, and Holy Spirit; yours is the kingdom and the power and the glory, now and for ever. Amen.</p>
