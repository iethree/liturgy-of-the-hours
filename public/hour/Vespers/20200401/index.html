<p>For all people in their daily life and work;
<span class="indent"> <strong>For our families, friends, and neighbors, and for those who are alone.</strong> </span></p>
<p>For this community, the nation, and the world;

<p>For the just and proper use of your creation;

<span class="indent"> <strong>For your mercy is great.</strong> </span></p>
<p>We will exalt you, O God our King;
<span class="indent"> <strong>And praise your Name for ever and ever.</strong> </span></p>
<p>We pray for all who have died, that they may have a place in
your eternal kingdom.

<p>We pray to you also for the forgiveness of our sins.</p>

                        <p>Accept, O Lord, our thanks and praise for all that you have
done for us. We thank you for the splendor of the whole
creation, for the beauty of this world, for the wonder of life,
and for the mystery of love.</p>
<p>We thank you for the blessing of family and friends, and for
the loving care which surrounds us on every side.</p>
<p>We thank you for setting us at tasks which demand our best
efforts, and for leading us to accomplishments which satisfy
and delight us.</p>
<p>We thank you also for those disappointments and failures
that lead us to acknowledge our dependence on you alone.</p>
<p>Above all, we thank you for your Son Jesus Christ; for the
truth of his Word and the example of his life; for his steadfast
obedience, by which he overcame temptation; for his dying,
through which he overcame death; and for his rising to life
again, in which we are raised to the life of your kingdom.</p>
<p>Grant us the gift of your Spirit, that we may know him and
make him known; and through him, at all times and in all
places, may give thanks to you in all things. Amen.</p>

As you have protected us in the day that is past, so be with us in the coming night; keep us from every sin, every evil, and every fear; for you are our light and salvation, and the strength of our life. To you be glory for endless ages. <em>Amen.</em></p>
