                        <p>Almighty God, giver of all good things: We thank you for the natural majesty and beauty of this land. They restore us, though we often destroy them.
<span class="indent"> <strong>Heal us.</strong> </span></p>
<p>We thank you for the great resources of this nation. They make us rich, though we often exploit them.
<span class="indent"> <strong>Forgive us.</strong> </span></p>
<p>We thank you for the men and women who have made this country strong. They are models for us, though we often fall short of them.
<span class="indent"> <strong>Inspire us.</strong> </span></p>
<p>We thank you for the torch of liberty which has been lit in this land. It has drawn people from every nation, though we have often hidden from its light.
<span class="indent"> <strong>Enlighten us.</strong> </span></p>
<p>We thank you for the faith we have inherited in all its rich variety. It sustains our life, though we have been faithless again and again.
<span class="indent"> <strong>Renew us.</strong> </span></p>
<p>Help us, O Lord, to finish the good work here begun. Strengthen our efforts to blot out ignorance and prejudice, and to abolish poverty and crime. And hasten the day when all our people, with many voices in one united chorus, will glorify your holy Name. <em>Amen.</em></p>

                        <p>Accept, O Lord, our thanks and praise for all that you have
done for us. We thank you for the splendor of the whole
creation, for the beauty of this world, for the wonder of life,
and for the mystery of love.</p>
<p>We thank you for the blessing of family and friends, and for
the loving care which surrounds us on every side.</p>
<p>We thank you for setting us at tasks which demand our best
efforts, and for leading us to accomplishments which satisfy
and delight us.</p>
<p>We thank you also for those disappointments and failures
that lead us to acknowledge our dependence on you alone.</p>
<p>Above all, we thank you for your Son Jesus Christ; for the
truth of his Word and the example of his life; for his steadfast
obedience, by which he overcame temptation; for his dying,
through which he overcame death; and for his rising to life
again, in which we are raised to the life of your kingdom.</p>
<p>Grant us the gift of your Spirit, that we may know him and
make him known; and through him, at all times and in all
places, may give thanks to you in all things. Amen.</p>

                        <p>Almighty, everlasting God, let our prayer in your sight be as incense, the lifting up of our hands as the evening sacrifice. Give us grace to behold you, present in your Word and Sacraments, and to recognize you in the lives of those around us. Stir up in us the flame of that love which burned in the heart of your Son as he bore his passion, and let it burn in us to eternal life and to the ages of ages. <em>Amen.</em></p>
